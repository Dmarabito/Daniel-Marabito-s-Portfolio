# a fairly simple project, roughly a hello world with a few variables. A first step really. I grabbed a pack of ramen I had laying around and stored the calorie info for it.
# I like the concept of the hiearchical variables so I used one for storing the calories for package and serving. It kind of is like a dictionary ins some ways.
# That said as it stands they are a bit less useful, I hope there is a way by using the top level to grab the lower levels. Will have to learn.
