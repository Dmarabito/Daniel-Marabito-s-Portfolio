# So this is lab 2. It was pretty basic, our primer on functions, infinite arguments, arrow functions, events and some async functions.

# Here is the Copy > Paste of the instructions.
<p>
Instructions:

In our Replit Team, start the Lab2 project. In the Replit project, there is a file called index.html. I have included the instructions in an md file and as comments in the index.html file - Note: they are the same instructions as the instructions provided below.
Add a function called add(a, b). Return the sum of a and b.
Add a function called subtract(a, b). Return a-b.
Add a function called sum() with no parameters. Use the arguments and return a sum of all of the values passed to the function regardless of the number of arguments.
Add a function called setTitle() that outputs the "Hello, this is Lab 2!" to the h1 element with id="title".
Add a function called studentName(name) that outputs your full name to the div element with id="student".
Add a variable to the page called secondsSinceLoad and give it a starting value of 0. Add an arrow function (no curly brackets, no parenthesis, no function keyword) called updateSeconds(). In the function, add 1 to the value of secondsSinceLoad. Display the current value of secondsSinceLoad in the HTML div provided with id="seconds". The display must happen from in the function.
Call setTitle() when the page loads. I have provided a page load event below. Put all of the functions that should be called when the page loads into that single function.
Call and output the results from add(10, 15); using document.writeln() at the end of the body element.
Call and output the results from subtract(45, 10); using document.writeln() at the end of the body element.
Call and output the results from sum(5, 10, 20, 30); using document.writeln() at the end of the body element.
When the page loads, use setInterval() to call updateSeconds() every 1 second.
Important Notes:
There is a function added where you should put the function calls for steps 7 & 11. document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function()
Make sure to create all of the functions to exact specifications asked for.
Make sure to call the functions for steps 8, 9, and 10 at the bottom of the body element in the script element provided.
