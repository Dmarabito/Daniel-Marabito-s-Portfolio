Use Lab 9 in Replit to complete the following. All pages - problem1.html, problem2.html, etc. - should be created in the Lab 9 replit.
1: Change Text Color on Button Click
HTML: Use problem1.html. Add a button and a paragraph element.
JavaScript: Using concepts from the JavaScript DOM Events resource, write code that:
Identifies the button element using its ID.
Attaches a click event listener to the button.
When the button is clicked, the event listener function should change the text color of the paragraph element to red.

2: Animate a Box Movement
HTML: Create a simple HTML page called problem2.html using problem1.html as an example. Add a colored box element positioned at the top left corner.
JavaScript: Using concepts from the JavaScript DOM Animate webpage, write code that:
Identifies the box element using its ID.
Uses a loop or setInterval function to continuously change the position (top and left) of the box element by a small amount in each iteration.
This will create the illusion of the box moving across the screen.
3: Toggle Element Visibility
HTML: Create an HTML page called problem3.html with a heading element (h1) and a button element.
JavaScript: Using concepts from the JavaScript DOM manipulation webpages (like getElementById() and style.display), write code that:
Identifies the heading element and the button element using their IDs.
Attaches a click event listener to the button.
When the button is clicked, the event listener function should toggle the visibility of the heading element.
If the heading is currently visible, the function should hide it by setting its display style property to 'none'.
If the heading is currently hidden, the function should make it visible by setting its display style property to 'block' (or another appropriate value).
4: Add and Remove List Items
HTML: Create an HTML page called problem4.html with an input field, a button, and an unordered list element.
JavaScript: Using concepts from the JavaScript DOM Nodes webpage, write code that:
1. Attaches a click event listener to the button.
2. When the button is clicked, the event listener function should:
3. Get the value entered in the input field.
4. Create a new list item (li) element with the entered text as its content.
5. Append the newly created list item element to the existing unordered list element.
6. Provide an additional button (or modify the existing button) to remove the last list item when clicked. You can use the removeChild() method to achieve this
