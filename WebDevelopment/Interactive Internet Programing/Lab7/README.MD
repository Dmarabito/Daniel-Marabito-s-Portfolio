# So this lab is about form validation. It also has some nice regex. There is a php file, that was completely made by my teacher. The HTML files are each one problem.
# The first problem essentially is about checking if a text input has text.
# The second problem is about email formating. I used a standard regex for email formating, although I did also make my own and left it commented.
# the third problem is a password type thing. I used several regex patterns to validate checking for certain special characters, upper/lowercase, Numbers. I also check for the length of the password.
# Problem 4 is making sure the first and last name box has text and that a select isn't using the default option.
