# This lab was meant to get us started with javascript.

# 1 Add a <script> element to the body where you'll place JavaScript code for Lab 1.
Create a variable called name using let and assign your full name to it.
Use document.writeln() to output "Lab 1. Completed by " and your name variable using string concatenation.
Use console.log() to output "This is Lab 1. Completed by " + name. Note: press F12 or go to Tools -> Developer Tools in you browser to open the Developer Tools. Then in Developer Tools, open "Console" to see the output.
Output content to the div with id="output" using the following assignment statement: document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = "This is my first JavaScript lab assignment.";
Add a for loop that outputs all values from 1-10. Use document.getElementById().innerHTML to output the value to the div with id="values". You must output all 10 values using the loop (not a single output statement). Separate each value with an HTML <br> element.
Add a while loop that adds all values from 1-10 together as a sum and output the final value. Use document.getElementById().innerHTML to output the value to the div with id="sum".
Create 3 numeric variables a, b, and c. Assign values to them. Output their sum using a document.writeln() statement.
Use a condition to compare variables a and b. Output "a < b" or "a > b" using a document.writeln() statement.
Use an alert() to output the value of your name variable and the results of typeof name.
