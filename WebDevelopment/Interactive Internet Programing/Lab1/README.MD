# This lab was meant to get us started with javascript. I did it in the index.html file.

# I copied and pasted the specific requirements below.
# 1 Add a <script> element to the body where you'll place JavaScript code for Lab 1.
# 2 Create a variable called name using let and assign your full name to it.
# 3 Use document.writeln() to output "Lab 1. Completed by " and your name variable using string concatenation.
# 4 Use console.log() to output "This is Lab 1. Completed by " + name. Note: press F12 or go to Tools -> Developer Tools in you browser to open the Developer Tools. Then in Developer Tools, open "Console" to see the output.
# 5 Output content to the div with id="output" using the following assignment statement: document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = "This is my first JavaScript lab assignment.";
# 6 Add a for loop that outputs all values from 1-10. Use document.getElementById().innerHTML to output the value to the div with id="values". You must output all 10 values using the loop (not a single output statement). Separate each value with an HTML <br> element.
# 7 Add a while loop that adds all values from 1-10 together as a sum and output the final value. Use document.getElementById().innerHTML to output the value to the div with id="sum".
# 8 Create 3 numeric variables a, b, and c. Assign values to them. Output their sum using a document.writeln() statement.
# 9 Use a condition to compare variables a and b. Output "a < b" or "a > b" using a document.writeln() statement.
# 10 Use an alert() to output the value of your name variable and the results of typeof name.
