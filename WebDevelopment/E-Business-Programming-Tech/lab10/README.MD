# So for this lab we make a password like thing. where we store a hashed password in a file and then allow access to a page if they can give the same password as the one registered. It also does some cookie and session stuff.
# The key files are register.php, login.php and landingpage.php. murder.php and expire.php are there primarly for easily ending a session, and expiring cookies.
