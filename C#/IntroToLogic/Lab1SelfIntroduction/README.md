#The program.cs file contains a bit of a self introduction as well I tried to show off a bit.
#Basically I added to it a menu that lets you randomize the color of the console, and a section that creates a .obj file.

#The .obj is basically just saving a text file with the .obj extention, but it has you pick xyz cordinates and formats them as vertexes using the v format.
# Then you make a face through an f line made of multiple numbers refrencing the v lines created earlier.
# With it being in a text based format it is hard to make an object that looks good.
#later I should try making this part again in a 2d or 3d format so you can see what you are creating.

#With the color randomizer I used a random number that goes through an if tree to pick which Console.BackgroundColor to use.
