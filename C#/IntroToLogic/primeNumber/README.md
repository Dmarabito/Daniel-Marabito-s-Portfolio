# This takes two numbers and lists all the prime numbers between them.
#
# It starts by taking 2 input and using TryParse to validate the input.
# It also checks that one number is bigger then the other, otherwise it uses a goto statement to reinput the info.
# It then goes through the range of numbers between the 2 numbers and checks if it is prime based on a function. It then prints it.
# there is also a bit where it checks if it is the first prime number writen to know if it needs to write a comma and a space.
# The function that checks if it is prime does so by going through every number starting at 2 and ending at the number.
# As it goes though each of those it checks if it is divisble by using modulo. If it is divisble then the number isn't prime.
