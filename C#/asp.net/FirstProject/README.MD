# So this is my first asp.net project. We used a few command lines to create it. and didn't do much with it.
# I noticed that uploading this project was a pain. Maybe I do need to use git for it. So there is a 100 file limit in one upload so I had to break it up into multiple. Also it refused to upload the hidden folder so I created that manually then uploaded its contents within it.
