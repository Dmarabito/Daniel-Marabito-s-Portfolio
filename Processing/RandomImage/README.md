# This program will go to the directoy stored in the String ImageDir, which by default is C:/image.
# From that directory a random file is selected. The file is then varified to be an image based on extention.
# As the verification is just based on the extention it filters out stupidity and not malice. As it could select a file with an image extention that isn't an image.
# I am not certain what that would do to it.
# Once the file is selected it is resized and then displayed as a fullscreen window.

# So what does this program demonstrate in terms of my capabilities? Well it shows I can use files and arrays, it shows I can generate a random number. It shows I can use a while loop. It demonstrates I can make a conditional with a lot of ands(&&).
# thinking back on it I could have wrote the conditional in the format (a|b) == false. It would have condensed the conditional.
# What I learned in digital electronics was itching my brain. I had to review the information because I forgot the name but this would be based on Demorgan's Theorem.

# If you are curious about the line //(); at the time I was writing this code my keyboard was being a pain as the number row was not working. So I put that in for easy copy and pasting.
# I decided to leave it in as it provides the code character.
