# So here is where I try and wrap my head around how the array of pixels generated by loadPixels() maps out to xy coordinates.
# In order to find out this information I had a chat with a certain Ai, and I doubted it's results, so I tested them.
# two diffrent tests LoadPixelCoordinateTest1, and LoadPixelCoordinateTest2.
# [here is a document explaining it in more details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZOgfALakolgiApvu1Eo1i08KGIREEPnRXpCV46G2oHA/edit?usp=sharing)
