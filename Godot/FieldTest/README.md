# So basically I wanted to test how fast my computer could update what I am refering to as a field. Basically that is a grid of values. In particular these fields are 3 dimensional using a dictionary with Vector3s being used as keys. I have it mark the time before and after filling each space in a size up to 500. It then prints details about the results.
# 155 was subsecond,  192 was sub 2 second, 220 was sub 3 second,241 was sub 4, 257 was sub 5. I think that is enought for recording, as it is coded now it goes up to 499 per side which is just shy of 38 seconds. This data can be useful since I can choose what size grid to break up things into depening on how much delay I am willing to accept.
