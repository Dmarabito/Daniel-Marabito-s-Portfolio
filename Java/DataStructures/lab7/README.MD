<p>
This lab was about using the provided classes for edge, graph, and unweighted graph.</br>
With that said the only file I worked in was Main.java. </br>
So in this I will only include the main.java, other files can be found in the repository linked <a href="https://github.com/Dmarabito/DataStructures-Lab-7/tree/main"> here </a>
