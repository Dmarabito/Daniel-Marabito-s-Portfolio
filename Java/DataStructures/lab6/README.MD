This is primarily a redirect to the repository that I made for this. I did upload the main file in this directly.</br> 
<a href='https://github.com/Dmarabito/Data-Structures-Lab-6'> here</a> is the link. </br>
So for transparency I did not write the MyMap.java, and MyHashMap.java files. Our teacher had us copy and paste it from the book.</br>
I did write main.java to save myself some copy paste with it I wrote some python code to generate the put lines.</br>
<a href='https://github.com/Dmarabito/Daniel-Marabito-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Python/SimpleCodeEditor'>You can  find the python here.</a>
