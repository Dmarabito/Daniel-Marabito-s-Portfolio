# So what I did was make a piece of code that will generate a descripition of scp - 1d6 - j, and then using the craiyon.py library have craiyon produce images of it.

# A bit on the ethics of this, as it uses ai art. I do not believe my usage of this hurts anyone. It isn't replacing jobs as I don't believe anyone is willing to pay to have all 6^10 versions of scp - 1d6 - j produced.
