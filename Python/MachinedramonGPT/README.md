<h> This is a chatbot made for discord using chatgpt. 
<br> For setup you need to make sure you are using the right global variables for your api keys.
<br> "MachinedramonGPTKey" is for the discord key. "OPENAI_API_KEY" is for the openapi key. "MachinedramonHuggingFaceKey" is for your hugging face key.
<br> You will also have to set the ChannelId variable to the appropriate for your setup. You will also need to make sure your permissions are correct.
<br> In the current version you can run it, and while it is running type messages into the discord channel that you set up with the channelId. It will then respond. If the message is too long it will split it up. It will respond to audio messages as well assuming the audio is turned on. It does this by using whisper's api on hugging face. 
<br> You can turn the speach off or on using ðŸ”‡/ ðŸ”‰ reactions, your choice is saved.
<br> The recombiner class is from a previous project.
<br> Updates
<br> It will now talk to you with a tts this can be toggled using ðŸ”‡/ ðŸ”‰ reactions, your choice is saved. 
<br> It now will present the reaction options on each message it sends.
<br><br>
<br> At this point I feel the core is done, anything past this is gravy.
