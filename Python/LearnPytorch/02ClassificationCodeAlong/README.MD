So this is me coding along with chapter 2 section of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A'>this video</a><br/>
The main point of this section is making a binary classification model, and making a multiclass classification model. I decided to upload a download of my colab version this time.
