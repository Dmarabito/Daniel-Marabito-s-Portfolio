<p>
So I did the exercises for chapter 2.
It involves making a binary classification model for sci-kit's make moons method.
On the multiclass classification side it involves using some provided code to generate data points from a spiral, and then making a multiclass classification model based off it.
there was also a middle part where we made a function for tanh.
So the exercises didn't explicitly state it but I took the presence of this function being made as a subtle hint that tanh would work wonders for a non-linear function to use in the spiral model. So I used it in place of relu.
Turns out I was right it worked just fine.
