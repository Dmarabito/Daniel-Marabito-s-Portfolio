# This is a class that I made for another project. I ended up splitting it off so I could test it more easily.
# Esssentially what it does is split a string based on punctuation into an array. Then it recombines the string into bigger chuncks keeping each chunk below 2k characters.
# Recombiner is the name of the actual class. The main file just basically runs it through with some generated large strings. I had chatgpt generate those large strings.
