# For part 1 I made an audit table. 
# part 1 v2 is a correction to part 1, mainly to account for the specification in later parts that they want the audit table to be split into 2 rows one old one new rather then having all that data in one place.
# I do think my way is better but, got to do what I got to do.
# For part 2, I set up a trigger when the courses table is updated it inserts 2 rows into the audit table.
# for part 3, I do an update to trigger my trigger, and show the result in the audit table.
# for part 4, I check if event schedular is on in the global variables
