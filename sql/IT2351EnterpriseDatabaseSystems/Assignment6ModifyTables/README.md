# So the subject of this assigment is using insert, update, and delete.
# part 1 involved inserting a row using the minimum number of fields which was 2.
# part 2 is about not identifying fields while inserting.
# Part 3 is about updating a field, in particluar in a previous insert we created a null that we fill in.
# part 4 was about using a single update to update multiple things based on your where statement.
# part 5 is targeted deletion.
# part 6 is about getting a specific error. Basically it is making a point that you can't delete items that are being used as a foreign key in a diffent table. Since enrollments has columns refrencing certain rows in couses they can't be deleted. I included a screenshot of the error.
