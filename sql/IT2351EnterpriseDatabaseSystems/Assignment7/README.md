# So this assignment has us making several tables based on a general blurb of text. We have to figure normalization as part of this.

# The first table I made was the ratings table, I ended up doing it in two scripts. I think for the future tables in this I will just do one script.
# The reason it is first is due to it not containing a foreign key. This means I don't have to add a foreign key after the fact.
