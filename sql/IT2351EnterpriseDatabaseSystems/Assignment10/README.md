# Part 1 of the assignment has me write a procedure and then call it. Basically the procedure shows items that are cheaper then a budget you provide.
# part 2 is about making a procedure with a bit of error handling, specifically for adding duplicate entries.
# part 3 is about making a function to calc a sale price.
