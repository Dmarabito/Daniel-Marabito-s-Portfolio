# Part 1 had me calculate a price, and round it. Give it an alias and round it to 2 decmial places.
# the main thing with part 2 is joining and using table aliases in the join.
# Part 3 had me join 3 tables.
# Part 4 is about that if. I use an if statement to check if there is a date. Then if there is I format it and show it. Rather check if date is null but same thing.
