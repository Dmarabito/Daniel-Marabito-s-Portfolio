# So I chose my final project to be based on dark souls.
# The first step was creating a database
# I then made a script to create all the tables, and fill them. This includes associative entites. It will also drop the tables if they exist. Figured that would be easier.
# I then made a view that summarizes details about what spawns to farm for what items.
# I then made a procedure to add spawns. It has some exception handling.
# I then made a procedure that will show the inventory of player with a name like the name inputted.
# I then created an audit table and a trigger for updating the inventory table.
# Then created an event that adds some new items.
# Created a player role and gave it some select capabilities.
# Created a 'GiantDad' user and gave it some privilages along with the player role.
