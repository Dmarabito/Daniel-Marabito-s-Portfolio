# The first part of assignment 2 was AlbumOfAliases.sql, in it I make a select statement where things are selected based on a range of prices, and assign Aliases to the columns.
# There was also some ordering of the rows.
# StepB is more practice with Aliases and with ordering and limiting with where.
# StepC was about date formating.
# StepD is a modification of StepC including an inner join to get the last names from a seperate table.
