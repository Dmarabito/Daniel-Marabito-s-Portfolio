# The first part of assignment 2 was AlbumOfAliases.sql, in it I make a select statement where things are selected based on a range of prices, and assign Aliases to the columns.
# There was also some ordering of the rows.
# StepB is more practice with Aliases and with ordering and limiting with where.
# StepC was about date formating.
# StepD is a modification of StepC including an inner join to get the last names from a seperate table.
# StepE is a modificaton of StepD but includes another inner join to add some more info, and combining first and last name.
# StepF has another join adding some more feild to stepE.
# StepG is a modified StepF, but I add a line that does some multiplication and I add a line limiting the rows to those with a null ship date.
# StepH is mainly about creating a calculated feild, using multiplcation, and rounding. It also involves an inner join and aliases
