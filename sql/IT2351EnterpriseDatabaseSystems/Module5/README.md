# This project is about table manipulation stuff.
# In part 1 we create a table.
# part 2 we create another table with a foreign key. Also one of the columns has a default date based of the cureent date. for whatever reason the getdate() was not working so ended up using (curdate()) I think it has to do with my version.
# part 3 is altering a table to add a column.
# part 4 is about creating an index.
# part 5 is truncating a table to remove columns.
# part 6 dropping a table like a sick beat.
