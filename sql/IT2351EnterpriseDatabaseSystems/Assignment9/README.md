# So part 1 is about creating a view, it also had some concats to condense name fields. Also tons of aliases. The big focus was making the view though.
# for part 2 I created a procedure to select student info and then called it.
# for part 3 I make a procedure to insert students into the table. I then call it to insert Weird Al.
# for part 4 I make and call a procedure to check if a given course number has a professor and show the name, or show a message about not having a instructor.
